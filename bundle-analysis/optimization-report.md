# Bundle Optimization Report

Generated on: 7/16/2025, 6:42:21 PM

## Performance Optimizations

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations
- Add proper loading states and skeleton screens
- Optimize image loading with caching
- Use virtual scrolling for large lists
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Bundle Size Optimizations

- Remove unused dependencies
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Optimize third-party library usage
- Consider using smaller alternatives for large packages
- Enable tree shaking in build configuration

## Caching Strategies

- Implement proper React Query caching strategies
- Add offline support with proper cache invalidation
- Use persistent storage for critical data
- Implement background sync for data updates

## Image Optimizations

- Use optimized image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement progressive image loading
- Add proper image caching
- Use appropriate image sizes for different screen densities

## Next Steps

1. Review the dependencies.json file for large packages
2. Implement the recommended optimizations
3. Run performance tests after each optimization
4. Monitor app performance in production

## Tools

- Use React DevTools Profiler for component performance analysis
- Use Flipper for debugging and performance monitoring
- Use React Query DevTools for cache inspection
- Monitor bundle size with Metro bundle analyzer
